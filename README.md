# My Hammerspoon config

Not very exciting, but suits my needs. 

## Hyperkey

`hyper-external.lua`

Setup the hyperkey and send hyper+g to Keyboard Maestro

## App launching

`hyper-applauncher.lua`

Basic app launching all done within Hammerspoon (it used to forward keystrokes to Keyboard Maestro but that got a bit messy)


## Window movement

`window-management.lua`

For window movement I am using [Miro's windows management](https://github.com/miromannino/hammerspoon-config). This gives me intuitive control over my windows using the arrow keys without being too complicated.

## Config reload

`config-watcher.lua`

Auto reloads Hammerspoon on save.
