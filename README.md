# My Hammerspoon config

Not very exciting, but suits my needs. I use [ClickySteve's config](https://gist.github.com/clickysteve/e13a11b8fc9c963c08b3109d95bbacc5) as the base. This gives me the hyperkey that sends hyperkey+otherkey out to be picked up by Keyboard Maestro which has all my application shortcuts setup within it.

It also auto reloads Hammerspoon on save

## Window movement

For window movement I am using [Miro's windows management](https://github.com/miromannino/hammerspoon-config). This gives me intuitive control over my windows using the arrow keys.
